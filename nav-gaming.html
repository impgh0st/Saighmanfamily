      <p>Fallout is a series of games that started in the late 1990's and revolves around a single player that lived in an underground vault after the events of WW3. The protagonist wanders the surface of a post nuculear war to find
        a way to survive. Through the journey, they find horrifying information on the company that creates the vaults, and possibly instigated the global war. <br><br>
        Fallout 76 was the first attempt by Bethesda Softworks to create a multiplayer approach to the game, and create a world that incorporates group progression, and teamwork. The characters that are played in the game are the first
        generation of Vault Dwellers to surface after 25 years of isolation. They are tasked with finding the Overseer of the vault and to establish a new form of government and currency. Through their voyage they encounter various other
        factions; Raiders, Brotherhood of Steel (the former US Army), The Foundation, The Responders, and the Enclave (Reminants of the former US Government). Each of these factions attempt to take on the taks of government individually,
        but have all failed. With the help of the Vault Dweller, these factions are brought together to create a functioning society in the mountains of Appalachia. Specifically, West Virginia.</p>

      <p>This game is a unique spin on a series of games called Borderlands. The expansion is from the mind of a tween named Tiny Tina, who is a Bunker Master. The idea of the game is a pseudo version of Dungeons and Dragons
        but uses modernized weapons. You play as a player character in a story created by Tina. Your goal is to save the Queen of the land and defeat the Dragon Lord. As you progress through the story, you create a unique character by assigning
        stat points, bonus skills and finding the weapons and armor that meet the needs of your character. Once you finish the game, the end game content is a crucible of extra levels and advanced gear. </p>
